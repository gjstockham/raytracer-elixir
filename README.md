# raytracer-elixir
Raytracing in One Weekend - Elixir version

This will implement as far as the moveable camera, but not depth of field.

It's intended to be a direct port as near as possible to the C++ version.  Any optimisations, or more idiomatic Elixir versions will be developed in separate branches.
